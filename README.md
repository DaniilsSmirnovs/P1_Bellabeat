# Data Analysis Project for Bellabeat, a High-Tech Manufacturer of Health-Focused Products

## About the company

Bellabeat, founded in 2013 by Urška Sršen and Sando Mur, is a high-tech company specialising in health-focused smart products. By collecting data on activity, sleep, stress, and reproductive health, Bellabeat empowers women with valuable insights into their health and habits. Having experienced rapid growth, the company has positioned itself as a leading wellness brand for women through its tech-driven approach and is now looking for new ways to expand their business.

## Business task

First, I need to identify the business task. To do so, I ask myself the following questions: 

1. Who are the key stakeholders for this project?
2. What are my stakeholders saying their problems are? What are my stakeholders expectations?
3. How can I help the stakeholders resolve their questions?

The key stakeholders for this project are Urška Sršen (Bellabeat’s Cofounder & Chief Creative Officer), Sando Mur (Bellabeat’s Cofounder & Key Member of the Bellabeat Executive Team) & Ballabeat's Marketing Team. They want to expand their business and identify new ways to capture a bigger audience. To solve their problem, I aim to answer the folowing questions:

1. What are some current trends in smart device usage?
2. How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?
3. How could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy?

Below is a detailed scope of work (SOW) outlining the purpose of my project, the major project activities and deliverables, and project's timeline. I communicate the SOW back to the stakeholders to ensure that they are happy to proceed with the project  and our expectations around the project are aligned.
