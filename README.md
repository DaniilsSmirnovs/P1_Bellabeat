## Business task

First, I need to identify the business task. To do so, I ask myself the following questions: 

1. Who are the key stakeholders for this project?
2. What problems are the stakeholders raising, and what are their expectations?
3. How can I help the stakeholders resolve their problems?

The key stakeholders for this project are Urška Sršen (Cofounder & Chief Creative Officer), Sando Mur (Cofounder & Executive Team Member), and Bellabeat's Marketing Team. Their main objective is to expand the business and explore marketing strategies to reach a broader audience. Urška Sršen has asked me to focus specifically on one of Bellabeat's products. She wants me to investigate how consumers are using non-Bellabeat smart devices, with the goal of informing their marketing strategy. To support them, I aim to address the following:

1. What are the key features and functionalities of non-Bellabeat smart devices that consumers use the most?
2. How do usage trends of non-Bellabeat devices align with Bellabeat's target audience?
3. How could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy?

Below is a detailed Scope of Work (SOW) outlining the project's purpose, major activities, deliverables, and timeline. I will share the SOW with the stakeholders to make sure we're all on the same page regarding expectations and goals before moving forward.
